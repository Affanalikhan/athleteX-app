## Firebase Configuration

### Prerequisites
1. Create a Firebase project at [Firebase Console](https://console.firebase.google.com/)
2. Enable the following Firebase services:
   - Authentication (Email/Password & Phone)
   - Cloud Firestore
   - Cloud Storage

### Setup Steps

1. **Download google-services.json**:
   - In Firebase Console, go to Project Settings
   - Download the `google-services.json` file
   - Replace the placeholder file at `app/google-services.json`

2. **Configure Authentication**:
   ```
   Firebase Console > Authentication > Sign-in method
   - Enable Email/Password
   - Enable Phone (for OTP support)
   ```

3. **Setup Firestore Database**:
   ```
   Firebase Console > Firestore Database
   - Create database in production mode
   - Configure security rules as needed
   ```

4. **Configure Storage**:
   ```
   Firebase Console > Storage
   - Set up Cloud Storage bucket
   - Configure security rules for file uploads
   ```

## Installation & Setup

### Development Environment Requirements
- Android Studio Arctic Fox or later
- Android SDK API 24 (minimum) to API 34 (target)
- JDK 8 or later
- Gradle 8.0+

### Build Instructions

1. **Clone the Repository**:
   ```bash
   git clone <repository-url>
   cd AthleteX
   ```

2. **Configure Firebase**:
   - Replace `app/google-services.json` with your Firebase configuration file
   - Update Firebase project settings if needed

3. **Build the Project**:
   ```bash
   ./gradlew build
   ```

4. **Run on Emulator or Device**:
   - Use Android Studio to run the app
   - Recommended: Pixel 5 API 30+ emulator
   - Ensure emulator has camera and internet access
